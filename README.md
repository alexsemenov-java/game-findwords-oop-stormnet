22/12/20

The code was written by a group of course students under the supervision of Mikhail Lazarevich (IT Academy Stormnet, Belarus, Minsk www.it-courses.by) in autumn 2020. 
Moved to the repository in order to look at the code over time and try to improve it when there is appropriate experience.
Also, the skills of working with GitHub. 


Rules of the game:

There is a field with pre-entered letters that make up 11 words - professions.
You need to guess all the words.
When a word is found and entered correctly, its letters are replaced with the * symbol.
The game ends when all words have been found and solved.
